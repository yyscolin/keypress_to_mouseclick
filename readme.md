# Keypress to Mouseclick

Have you played a game where you click and click and click like in Plants vs Zombies? Well, you do have to hurt your one hand only any longer. Now you can "click" your mouse using your keyboard. Just bind a keyboard press to a mouse click.

First, duplicate the file settings.sample.py to settings.py, then map the keypresses to a mouse click of your choice.<br>
Then you can run the script with `py main.py`
